Hello

I want to write a short review on Ardi - former Ariadne Organizer, since I was developer in Ariadne project and in InfoSelect before I can't really write as user of those products, most of the time I was on other side of the interface. In case of Ardi it is a little different, because I use it to read emails and maintain my notes. Ardi works with Gmail only but it is good enough for me. I imported my contacts and started maintaning notes in the middle of last year. It didn't have good support of popup notes back then and I liked minimalistic design of late Ariadne Organizer that offered somewhat decent management of popup windows. The developers team of Ardi did a good job on polishing interface and improving popup notes management - it happened last year and beginning of this year, now program looks mature and complete - as outliner and Notes manager, also it is good in processing emails. 

the website https://prokarpaty.net has tutorial section and demo videos.

Hi 

I am developer of Ardi - The Organizer and want to introduce new version of the program which is better than previous one and almost 
good as it's predecessors in their best time - Info Select and Ariadne Organizer. We, developers from Ardi team knew both products well when they were popular
and trying to follow best routes proposed and tested before. Some things worked well in late Ariadne editions - single slim selector with a lot of popups windows,
some solutions that were introduced in InfoSelect 20 years ago - like original Selector, email and data synchronizations have potential in modern time. We took some of the
ideas, added a few new ones (Blackboard) and did everything in a new way - from a black page. So now we have gmail client in Ardi but without overhead
of large data files, popup windows based layout with slim Selector but with added Tabspace and layout screens. We have topics, folders, bookmarks, emails, 
contacts in Selector, also notes, annotations and todo attributes. We receitly sertified Ardi with Google for Gmail API and Microsoft to list it on Store.
Ardi project is in late stage, it has stable interface, data and development cycle of 7 months. It is available for Windows and some betas for MacOS.

Please follow us on http://prokarpaty.net/

1.redo all the logview - get git of outlines nonsense, just plain text edit
    
+restore notes positions and size on startup
    
+ard::focusOnOutline doesn't work, we should put focus inside viewport, maybe..

1.edit default font issue - after creating new note.
4.popup relayout should prioritize and allocate largest layout for tspace
5.contacts groups members scene works with global filter, if it is active view is messed up.
